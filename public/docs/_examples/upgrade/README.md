Each subdirectory here (except for `adapter`) is a version of the
PhoneCat app.

Each version is fully functional, but omits the JSON data and image
files in the interest of keeping things clean. To run each app
in its full form, copy the `img` and `phones` directories from
https://github.com/angular/angular-phonecat/tree/master/app under `app`.
