  # Http
  
  Our application has become a huge success and our stakeholders have expanded the vision to include integration with a hero api. 
  
  The current solution limits us to a fixed set of heroes, but integration with a web server api will make our application much more flexible. We will also be able to add, edit and delete heroes. 
  
  In this chapter we will connect our Angular 2 services to make http calls to our new api.

  ## Where We Left Off
  Before we continue with our Tour of Heroes, let’s verify that we have the following structure after adding our hero service 
  and hero detail component. If not, we’ll need to go back and follow the previous chapters.

.filetree
  .file angular2-tour-of-heroes
  .children
    .file app
    .children
      .file app.component.ts
      .file app.component.css
      .file dashboard.component.css
      .file dashboard.component.html
      .file dashboard.component.ts
      .file hero.ts
      .file hero-detail.component.css
      .file hero-detail.component.html
      .file hero-detail.component.ts
      .file hero.service.ts
      .file heroes.component.css
      .file heroes.component.html
      .file heroes.component.ts
      .file main.ts
      .file mock-heroes.ts
    .file node_modules ...
    .file typings ...      
    .file index.html
    .file package.json
    .file styles.css
    .file tsconfig.json

  ### Keep the app transpiling and running
  Open a terminal/console window and enter the following command to
  start the TypeScript compiler, start the server, and watch for changes:

code-example(format="." language="bash").
  npm start

:marked
  The application runs and updates automatically as we continue to build the Tour of Heroes.

  ## Heroes and Http
  
  Let's look back at our `HeroService` implementation in the <a href="/docs/ts/latest/tutorial/toh-pt4.html">services</a> chapter. Specifically let's revisit the point we made about using promises when loading heroes. 
  
  Wrapping a simple constant in a promise might have seemed like overkill at the time, but we will show why this was an important first step towards moving to `Http`. 
  
  Let's get started by converting `getHeroes()` to use `Http`.
  
+makeExample('toh-6/ts/app/hero.service.ts', 'get-heroes', 'app/hero.service.ts (getHeroes using Http)')(format=".")
  
:marked
  ### Http Promise

  In our previous implementation we created a promise ourselves and resolved it immediately. When using `Http` we no longer have to create the promise manually. Instead `Http` will create it for us, but we have to call `toPromise()` to get it.
  
  In the `then` we convert the response to a json object by calling `res.json()`.
  
  Our api follows the convention of returning the result wrapped in a `data` property, but we don't want to expose this to the caller, so we flatten the response by returning `res.data`.   

:marked
  ### Error Handling
  
  At the end we are calling `catch` and passing in an error handler. This is an important step since it allows us to catch any error returned by the api. In the service we log the error and return the rejected promise. It's important that the service returns the rejected promise to the component, so that we can display an error message to the user.   
+makeExample('toh-6/ts/app/hero.service.ts', 'error-handler', 'app/hero.service.ts (Error handler)')(format=".")

:marked
  ### Promises are Promises
  Even though we made significant internal changes to `getHeroes()`, the public signature did not change. Like before we are returning a promise, so the callers of `getHeroes()` will not need to be updated.  

.l-sub-section
  :marked
    We realize there are alternatives to promises for processing http calls. We will encounter other approaches such as Observables in subsequent chapters, but for the purposes of this article we are sticking to promises.

  ## Add, Edit, Delete
  
  Our stakeholders are incredibly pleased with the added flexibility from the api integration, but it doesn't stop there. Next we want to add the capability to add, edit and delete heroes.   
  
  We'll complete `HeroService` by creating `post`, `put` and `delete` http calls to meet our new requirements. 

:marked
  ### Post
  
  We are using `post` to add new heroes. Post requests require a little bit more setup than Get requests, but the format is as follows:
  
+makeExample('toh-6/ts/app/hero.service.ts', 'post-hero', 'app/hero.service.ts (post hero)')(format=".")

:marked
  Now we create a header and set the content type to `application/json`. We'll call `JSON.stringify` before we post to convert the hero object to a string.  
  
  ### Put
  
  `put` is used to edit a specific hero, but the structure is very similar to a `post` request. The only difference is that we have to change the url slightly by appending the id of the hero we want to edit.

+makeExample('toh-6/ts/app/hero.service.ts', 'put-hero', 'app/hero.service.ts (put hero)')(format=".")

:marked
  ### Delete
  `delete` is used to delete heroes and the format is identical to `put` except for the function name. 

+makeExample('toh-6/ts/app/hero.service.ts', 'delete-hero', 'app/hero.service.ts (delete hero)')(format=".")

:marked
  We add a `catch` to handle our errors for all three cases.
  
:marked
  ### Save

  We combine the call to the private `_post` and `_put` methods in a single `save` method. This simplifies the public api and makes the integration with `HeroDetailComponent` easier. `HeroService` determines which method to call based on the state of the `hero` object. If the hero already has an id we know it's an edit. Otherwise we know it's an add.

+makeExample('toh-6/ts/app/hero.service.ts', 'save', 'app/hero.service.ts (save hero)')(format=".")
    
:marked
  After these additions our `HeroService` looks like this:

+makeExample('toh-6/ts/app/hero.service.ts', null, 'app/hero.service.ts')(format=".")

.l-main-section
:marked
  ## Updating Components
  
  Loading heroes using `Http` required no changes outside of `HeroService`, but we added a few new features as well. In the following section we will update our components to use our new methods to add, edit and delete heroes.
  
  ### Add/Edit
  We already have `HeroDetailComponent` for viewing details about a specific hero. Add and Edit are natural extensions of the detail view, so we are able to reuse `DetailHeroComponent` with a few tweaks. The original component was created to render existing data, but to add new data we have to initialize the `hero` property to an empty `Hero` object.
  
+makeExample('toh-6/ts/app/hero-detail.component.ts', 'ngOnInit', 'app/hero-detail.component.ts (ngOnInit)')(format=".")     

:marked
  In order to differentiate between add and edit we are adding a check to see if an id is passed in the url. If the id is absent we bind `HeroDetailComponent` to an empty `Hero` object. In either case, any edits made through the UI will be bound back to the same `hero` property.

  The next step is to add a save method to `HeroDetailComponent` and call the corresponding save method in `HeroesService`.
  
+makeExample('toh-6/ts/app/hero-detail.component.ts', 'save', 'app/hero-detail.component.ts (save)')(format=".")  

:marked
  The same save method is used for both add and edit since `HeroService` will know when to call `post` vs `put` based on the state of the `Hero` object.
  
  Earlier we used the `save()` method to return a promise, so when the promise resolves, we call `emit` to notify `HeroesComponent` that we just added or modified a hero. `HeroesComponent` is listening for this notification and will automatically refresh the list of heroes to include our recent updates.     

.l-sub-section
  :marked
    The `emit` "handshake" between `HeroDetailComponent` and `HeroesComponent` is an example of component to component communication. This is a topic for another day, but we have detailed information in our <a href="/docs/ts/latest/cookbook/component-communication.html#!#child-to-parent">Component Interaction Cookbook</a>  

:marked
  Here is `HeroDetailComponent` with the added save button.

:marked
  ### Delete
  
  We have added the option to delete hereos from `HeroesComponent`. `HeroService` will delete the hero, but we still have to filter out the deleted hero from the list to update the view.
  
+makeExample('toh-6/ts/app/heroes.component.ts', 'delete', 'app/heroes.component.ts (delete)')(format=".")  

:marked
  Here is `HeroesComponent` with the delete button.

  img(src='/resources/images/devguide/toh/heroes-list-delete-button.png' alt="Heroes List With Delete Button")  

.l-main-section

 ## Integration with Http
  
  `Http` is not part of the Angular core module, but exists as a separate add-on module called `angular2/http`. It ships as a separate bundle, so we have to include the bundle in `index.html`.
  
+makeExample('toh-6/ts/index.html', 'http', 'index.html (http)')(format=".")  
  
:marked
  The only other thing we have to do is import `HTTP_PROVIDERS` from `angular2/http` and register it in `AppComponent`'s provider array.   
  
+makeExample('toh-6/ts/app/app.component.ts', 'http', 'app/app.component (http)')(format=".")  

:marked
  ### Simulating the api
  Our hero api is not deployed to production yet, but for the purposes of this chapter we have decided to integrate with an in-memory web api.
  
  Looking at the `AppComponent` we notice that we have also imported `InMemoryBackendService`, `InMemoryDataService` and `SEED_DATA`. These imports are only there to configure the in-memory web api and will not be needed when integrating with a real api.
  
  We have included some more information about configuring the in-memory web api <a href='/docs/ts/latest/guide/server-communication.html#!#in-mem-web-api'>here</a>.
  
  Since we are integrating with the in-memory web api we no longer need `mock-heroes.ts`, so it's safe to delete it.

  ### Review the App Structure

    ## Home Stretch
    
    We are at the end of our journey for now, but we have accomplished a lot.
    - We added the necessary dependencies to use Http in our application.
    - We refactored HeroService to load heroes from an api.
    - We extended HeroService to support post, put and delete calls.
    - We updated our components to allow adding, editing and deleting of heroes.
    - We configured an in-memory web api.
